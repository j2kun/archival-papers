Archival Papers
===============

This is a repository of submitted, rejected, and accepted papers. They are
organized by the year of acceptance, with subdirectories containing the
versions submitted to various conferences. They include the reviews in a file
called reviews.txt

There may be an additional folder called 'data' in a paper directory containing
any additional resources used in the paper (e.g., raw psd files, small
datasets, programs)
