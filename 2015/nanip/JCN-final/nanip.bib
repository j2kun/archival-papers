note={doi:10.1093/comnet/cnu033},
abstract ={Complex networks are frequently used to model natural, social and engineered systems. A lot of studies looked at the problem of modelling the topology of a network or designing it. Less is known, even in a stylized form, about how one might optimally install a given network topology, assuming that installing a node aids the installation of neighbouring nodes. This problem arises in education where it is desired to teach mutually reinforcing words, as well as in engineering whenever damaged infrastructure networks are to be recovered. We introduce a new discrete optimization problem where the goal is to minimize the total cost of installing a given network. This cost is determined by the structure of the network and the sequence with which the nodes are installed. Namely, the cost of installing a node is a function of the number of its neighbours that have been installed before it. We analyse the common case where the cost function is decreasing and convex, and provide bounds on the cost of the optimal solution. We also show that all sequences have the same cost when the cost function is linear and give results on the cost of a random solution for several models of random graphs. Examining the computational complexity, we show that the problem is NP-hard when the cost function is arbitrary. Finally, we provide an integer programme, a dynamic programming algorithm, and greedy heuristics which give high quality solutions.},

    abstract = {This paper approaches the assembly-line balancing problem as a sequencing problem involving precedence constraints that prohibit the occurrence of certain orderings. This approach permits the formulation of a dynamic programming algorithm for the exact solution of small assembly-line balancing problems. A generalization of this algorithm combined with a successive approximations technique is used for the solution of large problems. In addition, certain combinatorial problems associated with partially ordered sets are formulated and discussed in detail. These problems arise whenever sequencing problems with precedence constraints are treated by dynamic programming techniques.},

 abstract = {Airlines face schedule disruptions daily because of unexpected events, including inclement weather, aircraft mechanical problems, and crew unavailability. These disruptions can cause flight delays and cancellations. As a result, crews may not be in position to service their remaining scheduled flights. Airlines must reassign crews quickly to cover open flights and to return them to their original schedules in a cost-effective manner while honoring all government regulations, contractual obligations, and quality-of-life requirements. CALEB Technologies developed the CrewSolver decision-support system for Continental Airlines to generate globally optimal, or near optimal, crew-recovery solutions. Since its implementation, the system has dealt successfully with several high-profile events, including the December 2000 and March 2001 Nor'easter snowstorms, the June 2001 Houston flood, and most dramatically, the September 11th terrorist attacks. In each case, Continental recovered quickly and obtained 
overall benefits worth millions of dollars. Continental estimates that in 2001 the CrewSolver system helped it save approximately US $40 million for major disruptions only.
