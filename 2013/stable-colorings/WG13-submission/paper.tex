\begin{abstract}
Motivated by understanding non-strict and strict pure strategy equilibria
in network anti-coordination games, we define notions of stable and, respectively, strictly
stable colorings in graphs.  We characterize the cases when such colorings exist and when
the decision problem is NP-hard. These correspond to finding pure strategy equilibria in the anti-coordination games, whose price of anarchy we also analyze.  
We further consider the directed case, a generalization that captures both coordination and anti-coordination. We prove the decision problem for non-strict equilibria in directed graphs is NP-hard.
Our notions also have multiple connections to other combinatorial questions, and
our results resolve some open problems in these areas, 
most notably the complexity of the strictly unfriendly partition problem.

\section{Introduction}

Anti-coordination games form some of the basic payoff structures in game
theory.  Such games are ubiquitous; miners deciding which land to drill for
resources, company employees trying to learn diverse skills, and airplanes
selecting flight paths all need to mutually anti-coordinate their strategies in
order to maximize their profits or even avoid catastrophe.

Two-player anti-coordination is simple and well understood.  In its barest
form, the players have two actions, and payoffs are symmetric for the players,
paying off $1$ if the players choose different actions and $0$ otherwise.  This
game has two strict pure-strategy equilibria, paying off $1$ to each player, as
well as a (non-strict) mixed-strategy equilibrium paying off $1/2$ to each
player.

In the real world, however, coordination and anti-coordination games are more
complex than the simple two-player game.  People, companies, and even countries play
such multi-party games simultaneously with one another. One straightforward way 
to model this is with a graph, whose nodes correspond
to agents and whose edges capture their pairwise interactions.  A node then
chooses one of $k$ strategies, 
trying to anti-coordinate with all its neighbors simultaneously.  The payoff of
a node is the sum of the payoffs of its games with its neighbors -- namely
the number of neighbors with which it has successfully anti-coordinated.  It is
easy to see that this model naturally captures many applications.  For example
countries may choose commodities to produce, and their value will depend on
how many trading partners do not produce that commodity.

In this paper we focus on finding \text{pure strategies} in equilibrium,
as well as their associated social welfare and price of anarchy, concepts we
shall presently define.  We look at both strict and non-strict  pure strategy
equilibria, as well games on directed and undirected graphs.  Directed graphs
characterize the case where only one of the nodes is trying to anti-coordinate
with another.  The directed case turns out to not only generalize the symmetric
undirected case, but also captures coordination in addition to
anti-coordination.

These problems also have nice interpretations as certain natural graph coloring
and partition problems, variants of which have been extensively studied.  For
instance, a pure strategy equilibrium in an undirected graph corresponds to
what we call a stable $k$-coloring of the graph, in which no vertex can have fewer
neighbors of any color different than its own.  For $k=2$ colors this is equivalent
to the well-studied \emph{unfriendly partition} or \emph{co-satisfactory
partition} problem.  The strict equilibrium version of this problem (which
corresponds to what we call a strictly stable $k$-coloring) generalizes the
\emph{strictly unfriendly partition problem}. We establish both the NP-hardness 
of the decision problem for strictly unfriendly partitions and the case for higher $k$.


\subsection{Previous work}

%need to discuss:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Kearns's et al~\cite{KearnsSM06} experiments on anti-coordination
%\item Theoretical work on anti-coordination in related models
%\item local max cut
%\item combinatorics work on unfriendly partitions and co-satisfactory partitions
%\end{itemize}

In an early work on what can be seen as a coloring game, Naor and
Stockmeyer~\cite{NaorS93} define a \emph{weak $k$-coloring} of a graph to be
one in which each vertex must have at least one neighbor of a color different
than its own.  They give a locally distributed algorithm that, under certain
conditions, weakly $2$-colors a graph in constant time. Interestingly, the 
lower bound is no longer constant when the condition is strengthened even to
two colors.

Then, in an influential experimental study of anti-coordination in networks,
Kearns~et~al.~\cite{KearnsSM06} propose a true graph coloring game, in which
each participant controlled the color of a node, with the goal of coloring a
graph in a distributed fashion.  The players receive a reward only when a
proper coloring of the graph was found.  The theoretical properties of this
game were further studied by Chaudhuri~et~al.~\cite{ChaudhuriGJ08} who prove
that in a graph of maximum degree $d$, if players have $d + 2$ colors available
they will w.h.p.\ converge to a proper coloring rapidly using a greedy local
algorithm.  Our work is also largely motivated by the work of Kearns~et~al.,
but for a somewhat relaxed version of proper coloring.

Bramoull\'{e}~et~al.~\cite{BramoulleLGV04} also study a general
anti-coordination game played on networks.  In their formulation, nodes can
choose to form links, and the payoffs of two anti-coordinated strategies
may not be identical.  They go on to characterize the strict equilibria of such
games, as well as the effect of network structure on the behavior of individual
agents.  We, on the other hand, consider an arbitrary number of strategies but
with a simpler payoff structure.

This paper also has strong relationship to the concept of \emph{unfriendly
partitions} in graph theory.  An unfriendly partition of a graph is one in
which each vertex has at least as many neighbors in other partitions as in its
own.  This topic has been extensively studied, especially in the combinatorics
community~\cite{AharoniMP90,BruhnDGS10,CowanE,ShelahM90}.  One relevant 
result is that every locally finite graph has a $2$-friendly partition 
(uncountable graphs, however, may not~\cite{ShelahM90}).

Friendly (the natural counterpart) and unfriendly partitions are also studied
under the names \emph{max satisfactory} and \emph{min co-satisfactory
partitions} by Bazgan~et~al.~\cite{BazganTV10}, who focus on partitions of
size greater than $2$.  They characterize the complexity of determining
whether a graph has a $k$-friendly partition and asked about characterizing the
$k > 2$ case explicitly as an open problem.  Our notion of stable colorings
captures unfriendly partitions, and we solve the $k>2$ case by giving an
algorithm that finds a $k$-unfriendly partition for all $k$.

Furthermore, a natural strengthening of the notion above yields \emph{strictly
unfriendly partitions}, first defined by Shafique and
Dutton~\cite{ShafiqueD09}.  A strictly unfriendly partition requires that each
node has strictly more neighbors outside its partition than inside it.
Shafique and Dutton are able to characterize a weakening of this notion, called
\emph{alliance-free partition}, but leave characterizing strictly unfriendly partitions open.  Our
notion of strictly stable coloring captures alliance-free partitions, giving
some of the first results on this problem.
%BP: Matching pennies is just a game played by a coordinator and an anticoordinator, and is more of a classic example of a game than something from sociological research - but the fashion game is their invention I belive.
Finally a related problem originating from sociological research, called the
\emph{matching pennies game} or the \emph{fashion game} is studied, among
others, by Cao and Yang~\cite{CaoY12a}.  In their version of the game, some
nodes try to coordinate and others try to anti-coordinate.  They prove that it
is NP-hard to decide whether such a game has a pure strategy equilibrium.  Our
work on the directed case generalizes their notion (something they suggested as
a research direction).  Among our results we give a simpler proof of their
hardness result for $k=2$ and also tackle higher $k$, settling one of their open
questions.

\subsection{Results}

Our main results are as follows.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \emph{$\forall k \ge 2$, every undirected graph has a stable $k$-coloring, and
such a coloring can be found in polynomial time.}  \\ 
Our notion of stable $k$-colorings is a strengthening of the notion of $k$-unfriendly partitions of
Bazgan~et~al.~\cite{BazganTV10}, solving their open problem number 15.

\item \emph{For undirected graphs, the price of anarchy for stable $k$-colorings is
bounded by $\frac{k}{k-1}$, and this bound is tight.  }

\item \emph{In undirected
graphs, $\forall k \ge 2$, determining whether a graph has a strictly stable
$k$-coloring is NP-hard.}  \\ 
For $k=2$, this notion is equivalent to the notion
that was defined by Shafique and Dutton~\cite{ShafiqueD09}, but left unsolved.

\item \emph{$\forall k \ge 2$, determining whether a directed graph has even a non-strictly stable
$k$-coloring is NP-hard.}\\  Because directed graphs also capture coordination,
this solves two open problems of Cao and Yang~\cite{CaoY12a}, namely 
generalizing the coin matching game to more than two outcomes and
considering the directed case. %BP: should we say "generalizing the 'fashion game' to more than two strategies" instead?

\end{enumerate}



\section{Preliminaries}

For an unweighted undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, let $$C = \{f | f: V
\to \{1, \ldots k \}\}.$$ We call a function $c \in C$ a coloring.


We study the following anti-coordination game played on a graph $G=(V,E)$.  
In the game, all vertices simultaneously choose a
color, which induces a coloring $c \in C$ of the graph.  In a given coloring
$c$, an agent $v$'s \textbf{payoff}, $\mu_c(v)$, is the number of neighbors
choosing colors different from $v$'s, namely 
\[ 
   \mu_c(v) := \sum_{\{v,w\} \in E} \ind{c(v) \neq c(w)}.  
\] 
Note that in this game higher degree vertices have
higher potential payoffs.

We also have a natural generalization to directed graphs.  That is, if $G =
(V,E)$ is a directed graph and $c$ is a coloring of $V$, we can define the
payoff $\mu_c(v)$ of a vertex $v \in V$ analogously as the sum over outgoing
edges:
\[ 
	\mu_c(v) := \sum_{(v,w) \in E} \ind{c(v) \neq c(w)}
\]
Here a directed edge from $v$ to $w$ is interpreted as ``$v$ cares about $w$.''
We can then define the social welfare and cost of anarchy for directed graphs
identically using this payoff function. 


%\begin{defn}
Given a graph $G$, we define the \textbf{social welfare} of a coloring $c$ to
be
\[
   W(G,c) := \sum_{v \in V} \mu_c(v).
\]
%\end{defn}
%\begin{defn}
We say a coloring $c$ is \textbf{stable}, or in {equilibrium}, if no vertex can
improve its payoff by changing its color from $c(v)$ to another color. We
define $Q$ to be the set of colorings in equilibrium.

We call a coloring function $c$ \textbf{strictly stable}, or in {strict
equilibrium}, if every vertex would decrease its payoff by changing its color
from $c(v)$ to another color. If a coloring function is stable and at least one
vertex can change its color without decreasing its payoff, then the coloring is
\textbf{non-strict}.

%\end{defn}

We define the \textbf{price of anarchy} for a graph $G$ to be
\[
\mbox{PoA}(G) := \frac{\max_{c' \in C}W(G,c')}
{\min_{c \in Q}W(G,c)}.
\]

\subsubsection{Mixed and pure strategies}

It is natural to consider both pure and mixed strategies for the players in our
network anti-coordination game.  A pure strategy solution does not in general
exist for every 2 player game, while a mixed strategy solution will.  However,
in this coloring game an analysis of pure strategies suffices as not only will
a pure strategy solution always exist, but for any mixed strategy solution
there is a pure strategy equilibrium solution which achieves a social welfare
at least as good, and where each player's payoff is identical with its
expected payoff under the mixed strategy.

\subsubsection{Strict and non-strict stability}

It is worthwhile to note that a strictly stable coloring $c$ need not provide
the maximum social welfare.  In fact, it is not difficult to construct a graph
for which a strictly stable coloring exists yet the maximum social welfare is
achieved by a non-strictly stable coloring, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:weakstrongwelfare}. 
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{0.40}{\includegraphics{strong-weak-welfare2.png}}
\caption{The strictly stable 2-coloring on the left attains a social welfare of
40 while the non-strictly stable coloring on the right achieves social welfare
of 42, which can be verified is the maximum social welfare for a 2-coloring of
this graph.}
\label{fig:weakstrongwelfare}
\end{figure}

\section{Stable colorings}

First we consider the problem of finding stable colorings in graphs.
For the case $k=2$, this is equivalent to the solved unfriendly partition
problem.  For $k=2$, the algorithm we give in the proof is also 
equivalent to the well-studied local %Is the algorithm really the same? The goal is different - MAX CUT tries to maximize edges across the cut, while our algorithm stops when each vertex has half its edges across the cut. I think this algorithm is the same as the local switch algorithm for finding a bipartite subgraph with at least half the edges.
algorithm for the MAX-CUT problem~\cite{ElsasserT11,MonienT10}, 
where the goal is to divide a graph
into two parts maximizing the number of edges crossing the cut.
To the best of our knowledge, no such generalization has been shown for higher $k$,
but our argument is a variant of standard arguments for MAX-CUT.

\begin{theorem}
$\forall k \ge 2,$ every finite graph $G=(V,E)$ admits a stable $k$-coloring.
Moreover, a stable $k$-coloring can be found in polynomial time.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
First we observe that for any graph $G$, $$\max_{c \in C} W(G,c) \leq 2|E|.$$
In a given coloring, we call a vertex $v$ \emph{unhappy} if $v$ has more
neighbors of its color than of some other color.  We now run the following
process: while any unhappy vertex exists, change its color to the color

\begin{equation}\label{eq:greedy}
c'(u) = \argmin_{m \in \{1, \ldots, k\}} \sum_{ v \in N(u)}\ind{c(v) = m}.
\end{equation}

Each time such a switch is made the new coloring has strictly higher social
welfare because not only $v$'s payoff increases, but also $v$'s switch
increases the payoff of more neighbors than it decreases.  
This means the overall social welfare will increase by at 
least $2$.
Because social welfare is bounded from above by $2|E|$, eventually no vertex will be
unhappy, which by definition means the coloring is stable.
Hence, a stable coloring is achieved after at most $|E|$ such flips.
%To get the time bound, each vertex can keep track of its ``unhappiness'' (number in Finding
%an unhappy vertex and updating the unhappiness of 
\hfill $\square$
\end{proof}

We note that because, in the case of $k=2$,
maximizing the social welfare of a stable coloring 
is equivalent to finding the MAX-CUT of the same graph, which is known to be
NP-hard~\cite{GareyJ79}, we cannot hope to find the optimal solution.  However,
we can ask about the price of anarchy, for which we obtain a tight bound.

\begin{theorem}
The price of anarchy of the $k$-coloring anti-coordination game is at most
$\frac{k}{k-1}$, and this bound is tight.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By the pigeonhole principle,
each vertex can always achieve a $\frac{k-1}{k}$ fraction of its maximum payoff by
choosing its color according to Equation~\ref{eq:greedy}.  Hence, if some
vertex does not achieve this payoff then the coloring is not stable.  This implies that the price of anarchy is at most
$\frac{k}{k-1}$.

To see that this bound is tight take two copies of $K_k$ on vertices $v_1, ...,
v_k$ and $v_{k+1}, ..., v_{2k}$ respectively. Add an edge joining $v_i$ with
$v_{i+k}$ for $i\in \{1,...,k\}$. If each vertex $v_i$ and $v_{i+k}$ is given
color $i$ this gives a stable k-coloring of the graph, as each vertex has 1
neighbor of each of the k colors attaining the low bound of
$2\frac{k-1}{k}|E|$. If, however, the vertices $v_{i+k}$ takes color i+1 for
$i\in\{1,...,k-1\}$ and $v_{2k}$ takes color 1, the graph achieves the maximum
social welfare of $2|E|$.  This is illustrated for $k=5$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:k5copies}.
$\square$\end{proof}

\section{Strictly Stable Colorings}

In this section we show the problem of finding a strictly stable equilibrium
with any fixed number $k \geq 2$ of colors is NP-complete. 
We give NP-hardness reductions first for $k \geq 3$ and then for $k=2$.
The $k=2$ case is equivalent to the strictly unfriendly $2$-partition problem~\cite{ShafiqueD09},
whose complexity we settle.

\begin{theorem} 
For all $k \geq 2$, determining whether a graph has a strictly
stable $k$-coloring is NP-complete.  
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This problem is clearly in NP.  We now analyze the hardness
in two cases.

\noindent \emph{1)} $k\ge3$:
For this case we reduce from classical $k$-coloring. 
Given a graph $G$, we produce a graph $G'$ as follows.

Start with $G' = G$, and then for each edge $e = (v,w)$ in $G$, add a copy
$H_e$ of the complete graph $K_{k-2}$ to $G'$ and enough edges so that the
induced subgraph of $G'$ on the vertex set $V(H_e) \cup \left \{ v,w \right \}$
is the complete graph on $k$ vertices. Figure~\ref{fig:edgegadget} illustrates this
construction.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{0.4}{\includegraphics{arbitrary-k-reduction-gadget-small.png}}
\caption{The gadget added for each edge in $G$.}
\label{fig:edgegadget}
\end{figure}

Now supposing that $G$ is $k$-colorable, we construct a strictly stable
equilibrium in $G'$ as follows. Fix any coloring $\varphi$ of $G$. Color each
vertex in $G'$ which came from $G$ (which is not in any $H_e$) using $\varphi$.
For each edge $e = (v,w)$ we can trivially assign the remaining $k-2$ colors
among the vertices of $H_e$ to put the corresponding copy of $K_k$ in a strict
equilibrium. Doing this for every such edge results in a strictly stable
coloring. Indeed, this is a proper $k$-coloring of $G'$ in which every vertex
is adjacent to vertices of all other $k-1$ colors.

Conversely, suppose $G'$ has a strictly stable equilibrium with $k$ colors.
Then no edge $e$ originally coming from $G$ can be monochromatic. If it were,
then there would be $k-1$ remaining colors to assign among the remaining $k-2$
vertices of $H_e$. No matter the choice, some color is unused and any vertex
of $H_e$ could change its color without being penalized, contradicting that
$G'$ is in a strict equilibrium.

The only issue is if $G$ originally has an isolated vertex ($G'$ will have an
isolated vertex, and hence will not have a strict equilibrium). In this case,
augment the reduction to attach a copy of $K_{k-1}$ to the isolated vertex, and
the proof remains the same.

\noindent \emph{2)} $k =2$:
We reduce from 3-SAT. Let $\varphi
= C_1 \wedge \dots \wedge C_k$ be a boolean formula in 3-CNF form. We construct
a graph $G$ by piecing together gadgets as follows.

For each clause $C_i$ construct an isomorphic copy of the graph shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:clausegadget}. We call this the \emph{clause gadget} for $C_i$.
In Figure~\ref{fig:clausegadget}, we label certain vertices to show how the
construction corresponds to a clause.  We call the two vertices labeled by the
same literal in a clause gadget a \emph{literal gadget.} In particular,
Figure~\ref{fig:clausegadget} would correspond to the clause $(x \vee y \vee
\bar{z})$, and a literal assumes a value of true when the literal gadget is
monochromatic. Later in the proof we will force literals to be consistent
across all clause gadgets, but presently we focus on the following key property
of a clause gadget.

\begin{figure}[tbh]
\centering
\scalebox{0.4}{\includegraphics{2-coloring-clause-gadget-small.png}}
\caption{The clause gadget for $(x \vee y \vee \bar{z})$. Each literal
corresponds to a pair of vertices, and a literal being satisfied corresponds
to both vertices having the same color.}
\label{fig:clausegadget}
\end{figure}

\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma:clausegadget}
Any strictly stable 2-coloring of a clause gadget has a monochromatic literal
gadget. Moreover, any coloring of the literal gadgets which includes a
monochromatic literal extends to a strictly stable coloring of the clause
gadget (excluding the literal gadgets).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
This last qualification will be resolved later by the high-degree of the
vertices in the literal gadgets. Up to symmetries of the clause gadget (as a
graph) and up to swapping colors, the proof of Lemma~\ref{lemma:clausegadget}
is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:clauselemmaproof}. The first five graphs show the
cases where one or more literal gadgets are monochromatic, and the sixth shows
how no strict equilibrium can exist if all literal gadgets are not
monochromatic. Using the labels in Figure~\ref{fig:clauselemmaproof}, whatever
the choice of color for the vertex $v_1$, its two uncolored neighbors must have
the same color (or else $v_1$ is not in equilibrium). Call this color $a$. For
$v_2, v_3$, use the same argument and call the corresponding colors $b, c$,
respectively. Since there are only two colors, one pair of $a,b,c$ must agree.
Without loss of generality suppose $a=b$. But then the two vertices labeled by
$a$ and $c$ which are adjacent are not in strict equilibrium.
\hfill $\square$
\end{proof}

\begin{figure}[bth]
\centering
\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{clause-gadget-lemma-small.png}}
\caption{The proof of the clause gadget lemma. The first five figures show
that a coloring with a monochromatic literal gadget can be extended to a strict
equilibrium. The sixth (bottom right) shows that no strict equilibrium can
exist if all the literals are not monochromatic.}
\label{fig:clauselemmaproof}
\end{figure}

Using Lemma~\ref{lemma:clausegadget}, we complete the proof of the theorem. We
must enforce that any two identical literal gadgets in different clause gadgets
agree (they are both monochromatic or both not monochromatic), and that any
negated literals disagree. We introduce two more simple gadgets for each
purpose.

The first is for literals which must agree across two clause gadgets, and we
call this the \emph{literal persistence gadget}. It is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:connectiongadgets}. The choice of colors for the literals on
one side determines the choice of colors on the other, provided the coloring is
strictly stable. In particular, this follows from the central connecting vertex
having degree 2. A nearly identical argument applies to the second gadget, which forces negated
literals to assume opposite truth values. We call this the \emph{literal
negation gadget}, and it is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:connectiongadgets}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics{connection-gadgets-small.png}}
\caption{The literal persistence gadget (left) and literal negation gadget
(right) connecting two clause gadgets $C_i$ and $C_j$. The vertices labeled $x$
on the left are part of the clause gadget for $C_i$, and the vertices labeled
$x$ on the right are in the gadget for $C_j$.}
\label{fig:connectiongadgets}
\end{figure}

The reduction is proved in a straightforward way. If $\varphi$ is satisfiable,
then monochromatically
color all satisfied literal gadgets in $G$. We can extend this to a
stable 2-coloring: all connection gadgets and unsatisfied literal gadgets are forced, and by
Lemma~\ref{lemma:clausegadget} each clause gadget can be extended to an
equilibrium. By attaching two additional single-degree vertices to each vertex
in a literal gadget, we can ensure that the literal gadgets themselves are in
strict equilibrium and this does not affect any of the forcing arguments in the
rest of the construction.

Conversely, if $G$ has a strictly stable 2-coloring, then each clause gadget
has a monochromatic literal gadget. This immediately provides an assignment of
the variables which satisfies $\varphi$. All of the gadgets have a constant
number of vertices, and so the construction is polynomial in the size of
$\varphi$. This completes the reduction and proves the theorem.
\hfill $\square$
\end{proof}

\section{Stable colorings in directed graphs}

In this section we turn to directed graphs.  The directed case clearly
generalizes the undirected, as each undirected edge can be replaced by two
directed edges.  Moreover, directed graphs can capture coordination.  If vertex
$u$ wants to coordinate with vertex $v$, we can create a vertex $u'$ and edges
$(u,u')$ and $(u',v)$.  Hence, this model is quite general.

Unlike in the undirected graph case, a vertex updating its color according to
Equation~\ref{eq:greedy} does not necessarily improve the overall social
welfare. In fact, we cannot guarantee that a pure strategy equilibrium even
exists -- e.g.\ a directed $3$-cycle has no stable
coloring, a fact that we will use in this section.

We now turn to the problem of determining if a directed graph
has an equilibrium with $k$ colors and prove it is NP-hard.  Indeed, for
strictly stable colorings the answer is immediate by reduction from the
undirected case. Interestingly enough, it is also NP-hard for non-strict
$k$-colorings for any $k \geq 2$. 

\begin{theorem} 
For all $k \geq 2$, determining whether a directed graph has a
stable $k$-coloring is NP-complete.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
This problem is in clearly in NP.  We again separate the analysis into two
parts: $k=2$ and $k \geq 3$. 

\noindent \emph{1)} $k=2$:
We reduce from the balanced unfriendly partition problem. A
balanced 2-partition of an undirected graph is called unfriendly 
if each vertex has at least as many neighbors outside its part as within. 
Bazgan et al. proved the decision problem for balanced unfriendly partitions 
is NP-complete~\cite{BazganTV10}. Given an undirected graph $G$ as an instance of
balanced unfriendly partition, we construct a directed graph $G'$ as follows.

Start by giving $G'$ the same vertex set as $G$, and replace each undirected
edge of $G$ with a pair of directed edges in $G'$. Add two vertices $u,v$ to
$G'$, each with edges to the other and to all other vertices in $G'$. Add an
additional vertex $w$ with an edge $(w,v)$, and connect one vertex of a 3-cycle
to $u$ and $w$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:weaktwocolornphard}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\scalebox{0.45}{\includegraphics{weak-twocolor-small.png}}
\caption{The construction from balanced unfriendly partition to directed stable 2-coloring. Here $u$ and $v$ ``stabilize'' the 3-cycle. A bold arrow denotes a complete incidence from the source to the target.}
\label{fig:weaktwocolornphard}
\end{figure}

If $G$ has a balanced unfriendly partition, then this corresponds to a
two-coloring of $G$ in which the two colors occur equally often. Partially
coloring $G'$ in this way, we can achieve stability by coloring $u,v$ opposite
colors, $w$ the same color as $u$, and using this to stabilize the 3-cycle,
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:weaktwocolornphard}.

Conversely, suppose $G$ does not have an unbalanced friendly partition, fix a
stable 2-coloring of $G'$. Without loss of generality suppose $G$ has an even
number of vertices and suppose color 1 occurs more often among the vertices
coming from $G$. Then $u,v$ must both be colored by color 2, and hence $w$ is
colored by 1. Since $u,w$ have different colors, the 3-cycle will not be
stable. This completes the reduction.

\noindent \emph{2)} $k\ge3$:
We reduce from the case of $k=2$. The idea is to augment the
construction $G'$ above by disallowing all but two colors to be used in the
$G'$ part. We call the larger construction $G''$. 

Formally, start with $G'' = G'$ add two new vertices $x,y$ to $G''$ which are
adjacent to each other. In a stable coloring, $x$ and $y$ will necessarily have
different colors (in our construction they will not be the tail of any other
edges). We will force these two colors to be used in coloring $G'$.
Specifically, let $n$ be the number of vertices of $G'$, and construct
$(k-2)n^3$ copies of $K_{k-2}$. For each vertex $v$ in one of these copies, add
the edges $(v,x), (v,y)$. Figure~\ref{weakkcolornphard} shows this construction
visually.

Now in a stable coloring any vertex from a copy of $K_{k-2}$ must use a
different color than both $x,y$, and the vertex set of a copy of $K_{k-2}$ must
use all possible remaining $k-2$ colors. Now we add all edges $(a,b)$ where $a
\in G'$ and $b$ comes from a copy of $K_{k-2}$. Each $a \in G'$ will have
exactly $n^3$ neighbors of each of the $k-2$ colors, forcing the vertices
of $G'$ to use the remaining two colors.
\hfill $\square$

\section{Discussion and open problems}

In this paper we defined new notions of graph coloring.
Our results elucidated anti-coordination behavior, and
solved some open problems in related areas.

Many interesting questions remain.  For instance, one can consider alternative payoff functions. For players
choosing colors $i$ and $j$, the payoff $|i-j|$ is related to the \emph{channel assignment problem}~\cite{vandenHeuvel98}.
In the cases when the coloring problem is hard, as in our problem and the example above,
we can find classes of graphs in which it is feasible, or study random graphs in which
we conjecture colorings should be possible to find.
Another variant is to study weighted graphs, perhaps with weights, as distances, 
satisfying a Euclidian metric.
